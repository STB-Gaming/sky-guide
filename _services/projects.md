# Beehive Bedlam
*tumble*
Aim: make beehive bedlum compatable with the standarsised keybaord controls and the controller userscript
progress:
i have created the ability to programatically traverse the menus (although i'm leaving the level select menu, that seems like it would take a long time)
moving on to playing the actual game, i'm planning on using the unit circle and having the mouse held down and move it in a circle around the cannon thing, whatever that's called
